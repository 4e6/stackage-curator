## stackage-curator

This repository contains the code for curating Stackage package sets and
building reusable package databases. It was originally simply called the
stackage package and was part of the stackage repository, but since this is a
tool very few people need to use, we split it into its own package with a name
to indicate it's limited usage (curators only).
